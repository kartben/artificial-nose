sentence=Arduino library for running machine learning models
paragraph=This library contains the signal processing code and machine learning models to classify real-world data for artificial_nose. It has examples for the accelerometer and microphone on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, but should run on most Arduino boards with an ARM core and at least 64K of RAM.
